abstract: "Image-text retrieval aims to capture the semantic correlation between images and texts. Existing image-text retrieval methods can be roughly categorized into embedding learning paradigm and pair-wise learning paradigm. The former paradigm fails to capture the fine-grained correspondence between images and texts. The latter paradigm achieves fine-grained alignment between regions and words, but the high cost of pair-wise computation leads to slow retrieval speed. In this paper, we propose a novel method named MEMBER by using Memory-based EMBedding Enhancement for image-text Retrieval (MEMBER), which introduces global memory banks to enable fine-grained alignment and fusion in embedding learning paradigm. Specifically, we enrich image (*resp.*, text) features with relevant text (*resp.*, image) features stored in the text (*resp.*, image) memory bank. In this way, our model not only accom- plishes mutual embedding enhancement across two modalities, but also maintains the retrieval efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MEMBER remarkably outperforms state- of-the-art approaches on two large-scale benchmark datasets."
